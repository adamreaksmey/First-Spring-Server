# Java Spring Boot Backend API

## 📌 Overview
Welcome to my first Java Spring Boot project! 🚀 This repository is a foundational backend API that implements key backend concepts such as authentication, routing, controllers, and role-based access control. The project is designed to be a solid starting point for backend development with Java Spring Boot.

## 🛠️ Features
- 🔑 **JWT Authentication** - Secure login and access using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- 🚀 **Spring Boot Framework** - Simplified backend development with Spring Boot
- 📡 **RESTful APIs** - Organized controllers for API routing
- 👥 **Role-Based Access Control** - User roles and permissions management
- 📂 **MVC Architecture** - Proper separation of concerns
- 🗄️ **Database Integration** - Configured database connectivity for persistent storage

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Java 17+**
- **Spring Boot** (Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, Spring Web)
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for authentication
- **MySQL / PostgreSQL** (or any preferred database)
- **Maven** for dependency management

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
 cd your-repo-name
```

### 2️⃣ Set up the environment
- Configure the database in `application.properties` (or `application.yml`)
- Update JWT secret key in environment variables

### 3️⃣ Run the application
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The server will start at: `http://localhost:8080`

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
The project includes user authentication and authorization based on JWT and roles:
- **Public Endpoints** (e.g., `/auth/login`, `/auth/register`)
- **Protected Endpoints** (require JWT token)
- **Admin & User Roles** (restricted access based on roles)

## 📌 API Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint           | Description             | Access |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------------|--------|
| POST   | `/auth/register`   | Register new user      | Public |
| POST   | `/auth/login`      | Authenticate user      | Public |
| GET    | `/users/me`        | Get current user       | Authenticated |
| GET    | `/admin/dashboard` | Admin-only endpoint    | Admin |
